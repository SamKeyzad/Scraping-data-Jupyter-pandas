# Scraping-data-Jupyter-pandas
Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. Wikipedia, being a vast source of information, is often scraped for various purposes such as research, analysis, and data visualization. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to scrape data from Wikipedia using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and the pandas library.
Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
First, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install it from the official Python website (python.org). Additionally, install Jupyter Notebook, which is a convenient tool for running Python code interactively in a browser-based environment. You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip, the Python package manager, by running the command:

pip install jupyter

Step 2: Importing Necessary Libraries
Before we begin scraping, we need to import the necessary libraries. In this tutorial, we will use the requests library to fetch web pages, BeautifulSoup from the bs4 package to parse HTML, and pandas to store and manipulate the extracted data. Here's how you can import these libraries:

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

Step 3: Fetching Wikipedia Page Content
Next, we need to fetch the content of the Wikipedia page we want to scrape. We can do this using the requests library. Simply provide the URL of the Wikipedia page as the argument to the requests.get() function. For example:

url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping'
response = requests.get(url)

Step 4: Parsing HTML Content
Once we have fetched the HTML content of the Wikipedia page, we can use BeautifulSoup to parse it and extract the relevant information. We can identify the elements containing the data we want to scrape by inspecting the page's HTML structure. For instance, to extract the table data from a Wikipedia page, we can locate the table element using BeautifulSoup's find() or find_all() methods.

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
table = soup.find('table', class_='wikitable')

Step 5: Extracting Data and Storing in DataFrame
After locating the desired elements, we can extract the data and store it in a pandas DataFrame for further analysis. We can iterate over the rows of the table, extract the text from each cell, and append it to lists representing the columns of the DataFrame. Finally, we can create a DataFrame from these lists using pandas.

rows = table.find_all('tr')
data = []
for row in rows:
    cells = row.find_all('td')
    if len(cells) > 0:
        data.append([cell.text.strip() for cell in cells])

df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Column1', 'Column2', ...])



Step 6: Data Cleaning and Analysis
Once we have scraped the data and stored it in a DataFrame, we can perform data cleaning and analysis using pandas' powerful functionalities. We can remove any unwanted rows or columns, handle missing values, perform calculations, and visualize the data using matplotlib or seaborn.
